Since then, SkySpecs has inspected over 95,000 wind turbines in over 27 countries, becoming the world leader in understanding the health of turbine blades. Identifying issues with turbine blades is only the first step.

At SkySpecs, our mission is to simplify renewable asset management so less can do more for the planet. SkySpecs is helping to make this possible by automating the operations and maintenance of wind farms using advanced robotics paired with our custom-built asset performance management software, Horizon.


SkySpecs launched the world's first completely autonomous blade inspection product in 2016 with a custom-designed drone system. Since then, SkySpecs has inspected over 95,000 wind turbines in over 27 countries, becoming the world leader in understanding the health of turbine blades. Identifying issues with turbine blades is only the first step. In 2019 SkySpecs launched Horizon to be a platform for SkySpecs to offer a multi-layered solution for customers that includes: data collection, wind turbine blade engineering expertise, and a place for all stakeholders to collaborate to manage and analyze massive amounts of data, spot trends, and create plans for high-cost repair campaigns.

SkySpecs envisions a world where wind energy is the most affordable form of electricity and therefore ubiquitous around the world. SkySpecs is helping to make this possible by automating the operations and maintenance of wind farms using advanced robotics paired with our custom-built asset performance management software, Horizon.


SkySpecs launched the world's first completely autonomous blade inspection product in 2016 with a custom designed drone system. Since then, SkySpecs has inspected over 25,000 wind turbines in over 15+ countries, becoming the world leader in understanding the health of turbine blades. Identifying issues with turbine blades is only the first step. In 2019 SkySpecs launched Horizon to be a platform for SkySpecs to offer a multi-layered solution for customers that includes: data collection, wind turbine blade engineering expertise, and a place for all stakeholders to collaborate to manage and analyze massive amounts of data, spot trends, and create plans for high-cost repair campaigns. Ultimately, this will help reduce the cost and risk of operations for the industry.

WHAT WILL I BE GETTING MYSELF INTO?
